### Disclaimer

_Although the project is very capable, it is not built with production in mind. Therefore there might be complications when trying to use the API for large-scale projects meant for the public. The API was created to easily use the It's Learning service programmatically and as such it might not promote best practices nor be performant. This project is not in any way affiliated with It's Learning._
